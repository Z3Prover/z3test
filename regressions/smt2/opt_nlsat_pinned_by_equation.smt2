; maximize y s.t. x^2 = 2 /\ x >= 1 /\ x*y = 1: the objective is pinned to the
; single algebraic value y = 1/sqrt(2). The model value of the objective is an
; irrational algebraic number, which used to be dropped when updating the
; objective floor (only rational numerals were accepted), so the optimizer
; reported -oo for this satisfiable objective. The floor now uses a rational
; lower bound of the algebraic value and the nlsat fallback recovers the
; exact optimum.
